title: About me
---

You have found Aleksandr Maksimov's personal page. I am a Computer Science student in the Australian National University. Please see my projects, research interests and CV below.

I'm also known as Alex or, occasionally, Sasha (or other [variations](https://www.justrussian.com/russian-names/) of my first name).

### Education

I am undergoing an undergraduate program in the ANU - Bachelor of Advanced Computing, starting 2025. I have graduated from Canberra Grammar School and have been awarded a relatively high scoring (41/45) International Baccalaureate diploma.

### Projects

See a comprehensive list [here]({{site.url}}/projects).

### Employment & experience

- I have been leading student initiatives in competitive programming since 2021, in both schools I've been in since then.
- I am a staff member at Canberra Grammar School, namely the IT co-curricular, [Code Cadets](https://codecadets.com), since 2025. I am mostly teaching students in year 7-8, but sometimes assist with classes up to year 12.
- I've been a private tutor in mathematics (has taught a talented primary school student and prepared him for Australian maths competitions) since 2024.
- I am a certified football (soccer) referee in the ACT and have been actively involved in officiating junior winter football since 2024.

### Mathematics

Since early senior school, I have been taking the highest levels of mathematics possible. In the ANU, I have taken MATH1115, MATH2222, MATH1116 and MATH2301 in the first year and achieved high results in all of those courses. So far, areas that sparked the most interest are abstract algebra and computation-related mathematics (complexity, type and automata theory). But I like analysis too.

### Familiarity with tools

- Python
- Haskell (beginner level, but ready to dive into advanced stuff)
- Unix system administration (basic)
- Basic familiarity with C, C++, simple webdev (vanilla JS) and databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL)

### Research interests

- Algorithm design
- Software security
- Type theory and functional programming
- Formal foundations of computer science

### Miscellaneous

- I love reading and arguing about urban planning, for Canberra is a great place to discuss such decisions.
- I've been doing competitive programming since 2021. See my [CV]({{site.url}}/assets/pdf/cv.pdf) for detailed info.
- Languages I pretend to speak: Russian (native), English (we'll probably understand each other), French (I'll do my best, but no guarantees).
