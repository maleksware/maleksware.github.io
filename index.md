You have found Aleksandr Maksimov's personal page. I am doing my 2nd year of Bachelor of Advanced Computing in the Australian National University.

I'm also known as Alex or, occasionally, Sasha (or other [variations](https://www.justrussian.com/russian-names/) of my first name).

### Education

I'm doing an undergraduate degree in the ANU - Bachelor of Advanced Computing, expected graduation 2028. I have graduated from Canberra Grammar School with an IB diploma amongst the best ten students in the cohort.

### Projects

### Employment & experience

- Casual staff member at [Canberra Grammar School](https://cgs.act.edu.au), namely the IT co-curricular, [Code Cadets](https://codecadets.com), since 2025. I am mostly teaching students in years 7-8, but sometimes assist with classes up to year 12.
- Private tutor in mathematics (have taught a talented primary school student and prepared him for Australian maths competitions) since 2024.
- Certified football (soccer) referee in the ACT. Have been actively involved in officiating junior winter football since 2024.

### Familiarity with tools

- Python (main strength at the moment)
- Haskell (beginner level, but ready to dive into advanced stuff)
- Unix system administration (basic)
- Basic familiarity with C, C++, simple webdev (vanilla JS) and databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL)

### Research interests

- Algorithm design
- Software security
- Type theory and functional programming
- Formal foundations of computer science

### Miscellaneous

- I've been doing competitive programming since 2021. See my [CV]({{site.url}}/assets/pdf/cv.pdf) for detailed info.
- I love reading and arguing about urban planning, for Canberra is a great place to discuss such decisions.
- Languages I pretend to speak: Russian (native), English (we'll probably understand each other), French (I'll do my best, but no guarantees).
